Description: Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) are geographic units of analysis. HRRs were developed by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care to delineate regional health care markets in the United States. HRRs are grouped zip codes based on the referral patterns for tertiary care for Medicare beneficiaries. HRRs also had to have a minimum overall population of 120,000, and the residents of each HRR had to receive at least 65 percent of their hospitalizations within the HRR. There are 306 HRRs in the United States, and their boundaries often cross state lines. For example, the HRR for Memphis, Tennessee, includes parts of southeastern Missouri, eastern Arkansas, and northern Mississippi.
