"The MedPAR File contains inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) final action stay records. Each MedPAR record represents a stay in an inpatient hospital or SNF. Each MedPAR record may represent one claim or multiple claims, depending on the length of a beneficiary's stay and the amount of services used throughout the stay."

"MS-DRG (Medical-Severity Diagnostic-Related Groups) Definition: a statistical system of classifying any inpatient stay into groups for the purposes of payment. The MS-DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses into more than 20 major body systems and subdivides them (745) for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement. The 745 MS-DRGS replaced the 538 DRGs previously used to classify Medicare inpatient stays. Instead of a two-tiered structure (with CC and without CC), MS-DRGs introduced a three-tiered structure: 1) MCC - Major Complication/Comorbidity; 2) CC - Complication/Comorbidity; 3) Non-CC - No Complication/Comorbidity"
"MS-DRGs replaced DRGs on October 1, 2007"
"Example of repalcement: DRG 127 was no longer the DRG for principal diagnosis congestive heart failure. In place of DRG 127 were three new DRGs: MS-DRGs 291, 292, and 293, depending upon the secondary diagnoses reported along with the principal diagnosis of CHF. "
