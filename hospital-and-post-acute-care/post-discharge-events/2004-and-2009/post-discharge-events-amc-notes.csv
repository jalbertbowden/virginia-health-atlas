Note
"Users are cautioned that, when the 95% confidence intervals for the 2004 and 2009 rates overlap, the change in rates between the two time periods is likely to have occurred by chance. That is, it may not be a real change."
"For example, the 30-day readmission rate following medical discharge at Nebraska Medical Center changed from 14.8% (12.9% - 16.7%) to 19.4% (17.3% - 21.5%). This change was very likely to be statistically significant because the confidence intervals did not overlap. By contrast, at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, the rate changed from 19.6% (16.5% - 22.6%) to 22.2% (18.3% - 26.2%). Because of the overlap in the confidence intervals, this change was not likely to be significant."
Thirty-day readmission rates for Maryland hospitals have been suppressed. For more information see http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/for-professionals/ooc/calculation-of-30-day-risk.aspx.
"Primary care and ambulatory visit rates are not reported for patients discharged after hip fracture; more than 85% of these patients are discharged to skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities and receive much of their follow-up medical care in these institutions. For other patient cohorts, visit rates are reported only for patients who are discharged home."
Ambulatory visit rates are not reported for patients discharged after surgery. Payments for post-operative surgical follow-up visits are bundled into the surgical charge. This means that early follow-up visits are not always reported reliably.
"Blank cells indicate that the rate was suppressed, either because it lacked statistical significance or because the number of patients was too small to report the rate according to CMS' rules protecting patient confidentiality."
