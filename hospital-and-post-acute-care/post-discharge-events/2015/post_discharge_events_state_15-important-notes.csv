Thirty-day readmission rates for Maryland have been suppressed.

Follow-up visit rates are reported only for patients who are discharged home.

Ambulatory visit rates are not reported for patients discharged after surgery. Payments for post-operative surgical follow-up visits are bundled into the surgical charge. This means that early follow-up visits are not always reported reliably.

"Blank cells indicate that the rate was suppressed, either because it lacked statistical significance or because the number of patients was too small to report the rate according to CMS' rules protecting patient confidentiality."
